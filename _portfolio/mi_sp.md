## Brain Tumor Segmentation
<img align="right" src="/images/bts.png" width="40%">
Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) utilizes multi-institutional pre-operative MRI scans and focuses on the segmentation of intrinsically heterogeneous (in appearance, shape, and histology) brain tumors, namely gliomas. The segmentation task is subdivided into
- segmentation of enhancing tumor (ET)
- segmentation of tumor core (TC)
- segmentation of whole tumor (WT)

## Melanoma Detection
<img align="right" src="/images/md.png" width="40%">
Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Although the mortality is significant, when detected early, melanoma survival exceeds 95%. The detection task is subdivided into
Automated predictions of lesion segmentation boundaries within dermoscopic images
Classify and localize clinical dermoscopic attribute patterns as binary masks
Classify disease categories for dermoscopic images

## Pattern Recognition based Mayo-electric Control
<img align="right" src="/images/premg.png" width="40%">
Advances in mayo-electric interfaces have increased the use of wearable prosthetics including robotic arms. Although promising results have been achieved with pattern recognition-based control schemes, control robustness requires improvement to increase user acceptance of prosthetic hands. The aim of this work is to quantify the performance of various pattern recognition based techniques (LDA, SVM, NN, DL) on efficacy of long-term robust prosthetic control.

## Brain Computer Interface based on Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)
<img align="right" src="/images/nirs.png" width="40%">
People suffering from neuromuscular disorders such as locked-in syndrome (LIS) are left in a paralyzed state with preserved awareness and cognition. In this study, it was hypothesized that changes in local hemodynamic activity, due to the activation of Broca’s area during overt/covert speech, can be harnessed to create an intuitive Brain Computer Interface based on Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Our analysis based on 6 overtly and covertly spoken words, using optimized support vector machine classifiers, indicates NIRS as a viable solution for future BCI applications

## Juxtapleural Pulmonary Nodule Detection and Segmentation in Lung Cancer CT Images
<img align="right" src="/images/lung_ct.png" width="40%">
Early diagnosis of lung cancer plays crucial role in the improvement of patients' chances of survival. Computer aided detection (CAD) system has been a groundbreaking step in the timely diagnosis and identification of potential nodules (lesions). CAD system starts detection process by extracting lung regions from CT scan images. This step narrows down the region for detection, thus saving time and reducing false positives outside the lung regions, resulting in the improvement of specificity of CAD systems.

## Bone Fracture Detection in X-Ray Images
<img align="right" src="/images/boneXray.png" width="40%">
Bone is tough, locomotive tissue of the body which is often subjected to fractures and degenerative disorders. For diagnostic purposes, clinician readily use X-Ray imaging. This provides researcher with ample opportunity to utilize image processing and analysis techniques for automated detections. Our work has focused on detecting these bone fractures and different types arthritis; Osteoarthritis Arthritis (OA) and rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

## Analysis of Retinal Images
<img align="right" src="/images/retinaAna.png" width="40%">
Eye disorders (age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma) can manifest themselves in retinal images. A good computer aided diagnostic system can alert the onset of disease resulting in timely treatment and/or preventive measures. Our work has primarily focused on diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma detection
